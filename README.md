# Smart-Eco-City-Simulation
This is another one of my projects , assigned to me as a semester project in the 2nd semster of my Bachelors in AI . It is based on C++ and utilizes the key concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) we learned during the semester . 

# Details
Smart Eco City Simulation is a C++ console-based project that models a futuristic eco-friendly city with various interactive components including buildings, transport, citizens, and power sources. The project showcases object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling with colorful terminal output and data logging capabilities.

# Features
Buildings: Supports Residential and Commercial buildings with energy consumption tracking.

Transport: Includes Electric Bus (zero emissions), Diesel Bus, and Cars with emissions calculation based on distance traveled.

Citizens: Citizens can perform different activities like swimming, gym, walking, and tree planting, impacting their happiness.

Power Sources: Models clean Solar Plants and dirty Coal Plants with distinct behaviors.

Emission Tracking: Tracks COX, SOX, and NOX emissions across all transport modes.

Activity System: Citizens can engage in activities affecting their status.

Logging: Logs actions and events to a file with persistent data storage.

Exception Handling: Implements custom exceptions for building upgrade scenarios.

Colorful Terminal Output: Uses ANSI escape codes to provide colored and user-friendly console output.

# How to Use
Add buildings, buses, citizens, power sources.

Simulate transport movement and emissions.

Upgrade buildings with budget constraints.

Log all activities and view logs from file.

Display total emissions accumulated in the city.

Interactive menu-driven interface.

# Technologies
C++ with Object-Oriented Design

Templates for logging system

File I/O for persistent logging

ANSI escape codes for terminal colors

# Project Structure
Smart_Eco_City_Simulation.cpp â€” Core simulation with menu and interaction logic

Classes for Buildings, Transport, Citizens, PowerSources, Activities

Custom exception class for upgrade errors

Emissions calculation and tracking utilities

# Why This Project?
This project is a practical exercise in advanced C++ concepts, combining real-world domain modeling with key programming paradigms such as inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling. It serves as a foundation for more complex simulations or smart city software development.
